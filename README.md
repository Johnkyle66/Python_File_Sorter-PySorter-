What is PySorter
PySorter is a simple python file sorter CLI app I made to clean, fix, and organize my files. Sometimes when I download or transfer
lots and lots of files, I sometimes forget organizing them so yeah why not let python do the shit.

How it Works
"""
First, by choosing a directory where you want files to be sorted
Scans the files in that directory and stores what type of files are there.
It then creates a folder named "PySorter" which will be used to store the files.
Next, it creates sub folders for each file extensions identified so there will be one for .docx and .pdf for example.
Finally, the program moves the files to each of their respective folder accordingly.
